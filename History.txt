== 0.13.0.b4
* Skipped past this release somehow

== 0.13.0.b3
* WARNING most importantly, support for ActiveRecord style calls now requires
  a require of 'clevic/sequel_ar_adapter.rb' in your model files.
* use Dataset in CacheTable and TableSearcher. Allows for ordering
  to stay correct when filtering views.
* use of Dataset allows filtering in TableView to keep previous ordering,
  and filter.

== 0.13.0.b2
* Squash various buglets as they're found.

== 0.13.0
* Now has Java Swing support with JRuby
* new code works with qt4-qtruby-2.0.3

* fix some breakage from Qt-4.5.x
* paste single value to multiple cells
* text field for multiline text editing
* fields now receive notify_data_changed. Clevic::View still receives it
  but by default passes the notification to the fields.
* add Clevic::TableModel#data_changed because the Qt dataChanged forced severe
  clunkiness defining new ModelIndex instances.
* Ctrl-S now saves current row. Display doesn't always update immediately though.
* add timestamp to types recognised as dates/times
* move field_column from Clevic::TableView to Clevic::TableModel
* Decimal fields now accept more variations - ',' as thousands separators
  is stripped out and a space can be used instead of a decimal point. No
  explicit internationalised decimal formats though.
* fix some weirdness with filtering
* fields now take an id property. So one field in the db can be displayed
  in several UI fields.
* fields can take default values in the UI definition
* save records after cell contents deleted
* various other bug fixes

* use Gather for hash/block value collection.

== 0.8.0
* Big improvements to the way the UI is defined in Entity classes.
* Show Entity-specific menus, both in the menu bar and as a right-click.
* Point it at a Rails project and see the models in a GUI. This
  has been tested on only one fairly complex Rails project, so feedback
  would be useful.

== 0.7.1
* Minimal model definitions inheriting from Clevic::Record

== 0.7.0
* Erm, stuff.
