== 0.13.0
* Now has Java Swing support with JRuby
* new code works with qt4-qtruby-2.0.3
* All models must now use Sequel. There is some code to ease porting
  from ActiveRecord
* preliminary and not yet working support for one_to_many fields in the UI
  
== 0.12.3
* fix closeEditor not moving to the cursor to the correct place

== 0.12.0
* fix some breakage from Qt-4.5.x
* paste single value to multiple cells
* text field for multiline text editing
* fields now receive notify_data_changed. Clevic::View still receives it
  but by default passes the notification to the fields.
* add Clevic::TableModel#data_changed because the Qt dataChanged forced severe
  clunkiness defining new ModelIndex instances.
* Ctrl-S now saves current row. Display doesn't always update immediately though.
* add timestamp to types recognised as dates/times
* move field_column from Clevic::TableView to Clevic::TableModel
* Decimal fields now accept more variations - ',' as thousands separators
  is stripped out and a space can be used instead of a decimal point. No
  explicit internationalised decimal formats though.
* fix some weirdness with filtering
* fields now take an id property. So one field in the db can be displayed
  in several UI fields.
* fields can take default values in the UI definition
* save records after cell contents deleted
* various other bug fixes

== 0.11.1
* Define views in separate classes (subclass of Clevic::View) while
	maintaining view definition inside the ActiveRecord::Base subclass.
* foreground and background color specifiers for fields
* better handling of virtual fields
* more tests
* make Clevic::Record a module to be included in an ActiveRecord::Base
* use Gather for hash/block value collection.

== 0.8.0
* Big improvements to the way the UI is defined in Entity classes.
* Show Entity-specific menus, both in the menu bar and as a right-click.
* Point it at a Rails project and see the models in a GUI. This
  has been tested on only one fairly complex Rails project, so feedback
  would be useful.

== 0.7.1
* Minimal model definitions inheriting from Clevic::Record

== 0.7.0
* Erm, stuff.
