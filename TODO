Using F4 to open list, and then selecting from the combo and exiting using Return (or tab?) doesn't set the correct value
wrap description, and allow Access-style zooming
filter-by-current throws if it's on a newly-added row
multi-row ctrl-delete not working
Undo deletes and other commands. Possibly via ActiveRecord callbacks.

resources for icons. use rbrcc

OSX
---
Check that qtruby4 runs on OSX and so does Clevic. It does. Very slowly on Leilani's Mini.

windows
-------
Ctrl-; date formatting goes 07--08 instead of 07-Apr-08. But typing the full month will be OK.

empty database
--------------
resize fields for first record, while it's being entered. use Qt::ExpandingLineEdit for ComboDelegate? Doesn't exist in Ruby bindings

editing
-------
F2 for standard edit, F4 for calendar edit
Only move for data_changed if field was exited with tab, not enter.
make sure record is saved when changing tabs
tooltips for tabs
Help in general for new data capture people
Help to right of tabs
messages for wrong dates etc
numeric months

Combos
------
shortlist combos by prefix. See Qt Examples.
turn on/off smart filters for relational delegates. Like selecting only distincts in the last year.
context menu for delegates, ie sort order, last used, etc

shortcut sets, depending on which OS you're used. use QKeyEvent::matches ( QKeySequence::StandardKey key )

Doing data capture, sort by id, but unfilter reverts to date/id rather than entry order
optional warnings for back-dated entries. Highlighting 
make sure bsearch easier to install

ORDER BY allow functions, ie lower(project)
handle db errors
test with sqlite
easier way to run models, search LOAD_PATH

generate models - DrySQL
Ctrl-PgDn to last row in this column. Also extend selection
sorting by header. See void QAbstractItemModel::sort ( int column, Qt::SortOrder order = Qt::AscendingOrder )
- layoutChanged

search with acts_as_searchable and hyperestraier
acts_as_trashable to undo deletes
implement undo of field changes

cache belongs_to associations, during loading, ie don't affect ability to pick up
changes more or less instantly.

moving of columns
/-style keyboard search by selected column, or everything if no column selected
/-style filtering?

for dates, add year if not specified, with 6 months on either side range. Configurable?
value formatting not in model
copy a field from a mouse-selection (ctrl-b maybe)
hiding of fields

save context menu settings, filter settings, etc
filtering by various things. http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qsortfilterproxymodel.html
highlighting by various things
cut and paste (in model and csv format)

drop cached model objects from CacheTable when they're not in use

allow scroll viewport to centre when at end of dataset
QAbstractItemView::ScrollHint

    \value EnsureVisible  Scroll to ensure that the item is visible.
    \value PositionAtTop  Scroll to position the item at the top of the viewport.
    \value PositionAtBottom  Scroll to position the item at the bottom of the viewport.
    \value PositionAtCenter  Scroll to position the item at the center of the viewport.


preferences
-----------
store previous searches, by model & app


maybe
-----
use rubigen for creating apps
allow moving of rows
discontiguous copying of entities/csv
multi-row copying
pasting of csv, into rectangular regions
collect a set of data requests to the model, and do them in one SQL query. See EntryTableView#moveCursor
Use SQL cursors for find & find_next?

Accounts
--------
paste of "common" records with different dates
restricted type for Account Type record

Times
-----

warnings on overlap times (in status bar)
warnings on large intervals (in status bar)
