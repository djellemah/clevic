Use ZenTest to generate tests
Check out ar-extensions
make sure ActiveRecord doesn't keep updating columns. ie production mode.
Use ActiveRecord 2.1 for changed. Note will_change! method
use Pathname#find to find the Rails files
Ramen http://ramen.rubyforge.org/ for metadata. MySQL and MSSQL only right now.

tests
allow directories for a setup. Problem here is tab order.
metadata for virtual fields
consolidate metadata across TableModel, and Field. Would like to have it all in Field.
generate models - DrySQL
allow moving of tabs
habtm relations
has_many :through
composed_of & aggregates
generate schema from definition? See rubyforge
Ctrl-PgDn to last row in this column. Also extend selection
sorting by header. See void QAbstractItemModel::sort ( int column, Qt::SortOrder order = Qt::AscendingOrder )
- layoutChanged

undo
- acts_as_trashable to undo deletes
- other commands. Possibly via ActiveRecord callbacks?
- Keep a history of changes, ie xy, new. xy, changed. x,y copied etc.
- Use Transaction::Simple?
- undo of field changes
- memoize

Using F4 to open list, and then selecting from the combo and exiting using Return (or tab?) doesn't set the correct value
wrap description, and allow Access-style zooming
Ctrl-PgDn to last row in this column. Also extend selection
sorting by header. See void QAbstractItemModel::sort ( int column, Qt::SortOrder order = Qt::AscendingOrder )

search with acts_as_searchable and hyperestraier

moving of columns
/-style keyboard search by selected column, or everything if no column selected
/-style filtering?

for dates, add year if not specified, with 6 months on either side range. Configurable?
value formatting not in model
copy a field from a mouse-selection (ctrl-b maybe)
hiding of fields

save context menu settings, filter settings, etc
filtering by various things. http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qsortfilterproxymodel.html
highlighting by various things
cut and paste (in model format)

drop cached model objects from CacheTable when they're not in use. WeakRef?

allow scroll viewport to centre when at end of dataset
QAbstractItemView::ScrollHint

    \value EnsureVisible  Scroll to ensure that the item is visible.
    \value PositionAtTop  Scroll to position the item at the top of the viewport.
    \value PositionAtBottom  Scroll to position the item at the bottom of the viewport.
    \value PositionAtCenter  Scroll to position the item at the center of the viewport.

Reports
-------
Use Webrick as a way to export CSV reports?
See Ruport and Documatic for reports
Ruby Datavision Bridge for reports

OSX
---
Check that qtruby4 runs on OSX and so does Clevic. It does. Very slowly on Mac Mini with Motorola.

windows
-------
Ctrl-; date formatting goes 07--08 instead of 07-Apr-08. But typing the full month will be OK.

empty database
--------------
resize fields for first record, while it's being entered. use Qt::ExpandingLineEdit for ComboDelegate? Doesn't exist in Ruby bindings

editing
-------
F2 for standard edit, F4 for calendar edit
Only move for data_changed if field was exited with tab, not enter.
tooltips for tabs
Help in general for new data capture people
Help to right of tabs
messages for wrong dates etc
numeric months

Combos
------
shortlist combos by prefix. See Qt Examples.
turn on/off smart filters for relational delegates. Like selecting only distincts in the last year.
context menu for delegates, ie sort order, last used, etc

shortcut sets, depending on which OS you're used. use QKeyEvent::matches ( QKeySequence::StandardKey key )

Doing data capture, sort by id, but unfilter reverts to date/id rather than entry order
optional warnings for back-dated entries. Highlighting 
make bsearch easier to install

handle db errors
easier way to run models, search LOAD_PATH

cache belongs_to associations, during loading, but don't affect ability to pick up
changes more or less instantly.

preferences
-----------
store previous searches, by model & app

maybe
-----
acts_as_shellable looks nices
consolidate read-only-ness checks 
Look at DataMapper. Not suitable - need to declare properties.
use rubigen for creating model definition files
ActiveMDB for migrating.
allow moving of rows
discontiguous copying of entities/csv
multi-row copying
pasting of csv, into rectangular regions
collect a set of data requests to the model, and do them in one SQL query. See EntryTableView#moveCursor
Use SQL cursors for find & find_next?
Use roo to parse spreadsheets?
Criteria for SQL statement building http://criteria.rubyforge.org/
SqlCache
SqlStatement
Csv2Sql
QueryBuilder

Accounts
--------
paste of "common" records with different dates
restricted type for Account Type record

Times
-----

Ctrl-Shift-" should not copy date if it already exists, and should not copy time if it's a different date.
Ctrl-Shift-" after it's done, tab doesn't change fields
look up invoice for project leaves the wrong fields highlighted, and focus in the wrong field.
warnings on overlap times (in status bar, or highlight)
warnings on large intervals (in status bar, or highlight)
