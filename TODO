map / restricted fields: sample not working, mapping not working
Sort out the whole /bin/clevic vs gem 'clevic', '~> 0.12.0' thing.
Meta should be related to ModelColumn somehow. Which is pretty messy itself.

can't use find on certain fields, ie code in adjustments. Partially fixed.

export to CSV
Accounts not landing after Ditto with auto-fill-in
cut'n'paste in text/plain, text/csv, text/yml and application/clevic
provide for easier directories for a setup.
ModelBuilder#modify_field to override default_ui definitions. Or a better way to reuse field definitions.
use rubigen for creating model definition files?
undoable_command signal for delegates

need a map field (For ie -1 = short, 1 = long). Already in restricted, but it's kinda clunky.

Add additional :filter record sets that can be selected from menus?

filter and search by virtual fields

tests. Use ZenTest to generate tests?
caching of repeated related entity lookups.

metadata for virtual fields. Add a member to Field for class_name.constantize
consolidate metadata across TableModel, and Field. Would like to have it all in Field.
gui_value vs attribute_value vs field_value etc
generate models - DrySQL
allow moving of tabs
habtm relations
has_many :through
composed_of & aggregates
generate schema from definition? See rubyforge
Ctrl-PgDn to last row in this column. Also extend selection
sorting by header. See void QAbstractItemModel::sort ( int column, Qt::SortOrder order = Qt::AscendingOrder )
- layoutChanged

undo
- could possibly handle this in the TableModel
- acts_as_trashable to undo deletes
- other commands. Possibly via ActiveRecord callbacks?
- Keep a history of changes, ie xy, new. xy, changed. x,y copied etc.
- Use Transaction::Simple?
- undo of field changes
- memoize

Using F4 to open list, and then selecting from the combo and exiting using Return (or tab?) doesn't set the correct value
wrap description, and allow Access-style zooming

search with acts_as_searchable and hyperestraier

moving of columns
/-style keyboard search by selected column, or everything if no column selected
/-style filtering?

for dates, add year if not specified, with 6 months on either side range. Configurable?
value parsing not in model
copy a field from a mouse-selection (ctrl-b maybe)
hiding of fields

save context menu settings, filter settings, etc
filtering by various things. http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qsortfilterproxymodel.html
highlighting by various things
cut and paste (in model format. Could use indirect format ie table/row/column. Kinda pointless though since references would essentially do the same thing.)

drop cached model objects from CacheTable when they're not in use. WeakRef?

allow scroll viewport to centre when at end of dataset
QAbstractItemView::ScrollHint

    \value EnsureVisible  Scroll to ensure that the item is visible.
    \value PositionAtTop  Scroll to position the item at the top of the viewport.
    \value PositionAtBottom  Scroll to position the item at the bottom of the viewport.
    \value PositionAtCenter  Scroll to position the item at the center of the viewport.

Reports
-------
Use Webrick as a way to export CSV reports?
See Ruport and Documatic for reports
Ruby Datavision Bridge for reports

OSX
---
Check that qtruby4 runs on OSX and so does Clevic. It does. Very slowly on Mac Mini with Motorola.

windows
-------
Ctrl-; date formatting goes 07--08 instead of 07-Apr-08. But typing the full month will be OK.

empty database
--------------
resize fields for first record, while it's being entered. use Qt::ExpandingLineEdit for ComboDelegate? Doesn't exist in Ruby bindings.

editing
-------
F2 for standard edit, F4 for full edit, ie text window, or calendar edit
Only move for data_changed if field was exited with tab, not enter.
tooltips for tabs
Help in general for new data capture people
Help to right of tabs
messages for wrong dates etc
numeric months

Combos
------
shortlist combos by prefix. See Qt Examples.
turn on/off smart filters for relational delegates. Like selecting only distincts in the last year.
context menu for delegates, ie sort order, last used, etc

shortcut sets, depending on which OS you're used. use QKeyEvent::matches ( QKeySequence::StandardKey key )

Doing data capture, sort by id, but unfilter reverts to date/id rather than entry order
optional warnings for back-dated entries. Highlighting 
make bsearch easier to install

handle db errors
easier way to run models, search LOAD_PATH

cache belongs_to associations, during loading, but don't affect ability to pick up
changes more or less instantly.

preferences
-----------
store previous searches, by model & app
store year ranges for 2 digit years in dates.

maybe
-----
acts_as_shellable looks nice
consolidate read-only-ness checks 
ActiveMDB for migrating?
allow moving of rows
discontiguous copying of entities/csv
multi-row copying
pasting of csv, into rectangular regions
collect a set of data requests to the model, and do them in one SQL query. See EntryTableView#moveCursor
Use SQL cursors for find & find_next?
Use roo to parse spreadsheets?
SqlCache
SqlStatement
Csv2Sql
QueryBuilder

Accounts
--------
paste of "common" records with different dates
