implement save on window close?, or whatever
keyboard search by selected column, or everything if no column selected

add year if not specified, with 6 months on either side range
value formatting not in model

smart copy, to insert a most-likely value
hiding of fields

project/invoice/activity editing
turn on/off smart filters
filtering by various things
highlighting by various things
cut and paste (in model and csv format)
paste of "common" records with different dates
sorting by header

deal with large datasets. Keep only indices and load entities as necessary.
with some kind of cache.

refresh from db

fix ctrl-' not working when text field already in edit mode. Make sure
  tab press does the same as pressing enter, ie change mode away from editing

better validation messages

allow scroll viewport to centre when at end of dataset
wrap description, and allow Access-style zooming
warnings on overlap times
warnings on large intervals
moving of columns
Ctrl-PgDn to last row in this column. Also extend selection

maybe

allow moving of rows
discontiguous copying of entities/csv
multi-row copying
