Screenshot of a fully defined UI with the foreign-key dropdown in place.
Tabs contain the two tables.

See "RDoc":rdoc for feature list.
See "ModelBuilder":rdoc/Clevic/ModelBuilder.html for how to define views.

Code for minimal UI definition. Clevic will create a fairly sensible
UI from the DB metadata.

<pre><code>
<%= File.read 'models/minimal_models.rb' %>
</code></pre>

Code for a full definition. The Entry model has some code to
update the credit and debit fields when the new item description
is found in the table.

<pre><code>
<%= File.read 'models/accounts_models.rb' %>
</code></pre>
