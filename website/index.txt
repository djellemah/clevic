Clevic is a relational table GUI toolkit. It works with Qt or Java/Swing and "Sequel":http://sequel.rubyforge.org.
An interesting side-effect of this will probably be that building form-style GUIs will be possible. Eventually. When the code has been written.
Lots more in the "RDoc":rdoc pages.

Screenshot of a fully defined UI with the foreign-key dropdown in place. Tabs contain the two tables.

See "ModelBuilder":rdoc/Clevic/ModelBuilder.html for how to define views.

Code for minimal UI definition. Clevic will create a fairly sensible UI from the DB metadata.

<pre><code>
<%= File.read 'models/minimal_models.rb' %>
</code></pre>

Code for a full definition. The Entry model has some code to
update the credit and debit fields when the new item description
is found in the table.

<pre><code>
<%= File.read 'models/accounts_models.rb' %>
</code></pre>
