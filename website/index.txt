Clevic is a toolkit for building GUIs database tables with useful functionality.
It works with Qt and ActiveRecord. In the works are JRuby with Swing for the GUI
and Sequel for the ORM. An interesting side-effect of this will probably be that
building form-style GUIs will be possible.

Screenshot of a fully defined UI with the foreign-key dropdown in place.
Tabs contain the two tables.

See "RDoc":rdoc for feature list.
See "ModelBuilder":rdoc/Clevic/ModelBuilder.html for how to define views.

Code for minimal UI definition. Clevic will create a fairly sensible
UI from the DB metadata.

<pre><code>
<%= File.read 'models/minimal_models.rb' %>
</code></pre>

Code for a full definition. The Entry model has some code to
update the credit and debit fields when the new item description
is found in the table.

<pre><code>
<%= File.read 'models/accounts_models.rb' %>
</code></pre>
